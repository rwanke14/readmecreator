Referenced a github overview of how to set up your markdown for a readme file: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/.

Also worked with my study group to better understand how to apply what we learned in class to this readme. Note: Some code may look similar since we generally come out these thing in the same ways.

Feedback, brainstorming, and general support to study group:
